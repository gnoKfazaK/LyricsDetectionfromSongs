# LyricsDetectionfromSongs
### Only the bot folder is useful. <br> 
Feel free to look at my failed training models and my very untidy jupytert notebook in the "OtherUselessStuff" :) <br>
This project is about lyrics detection from songs. This will be presented as a telegram bot that users can upload an audio file, and the bot will return the lyrics to the user. 
### Model
The model that will be used for the bot is the Open-AI Whisper model
### Deep Learning
Even though deep learning has not being applied in this project. <br>
Deep learning can still be applied for a better accuracy of detection. <br>
If deep learing is applied, the scope of the trained model will be the vocals of the songs that are being trained.
